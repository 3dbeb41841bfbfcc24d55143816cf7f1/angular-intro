What makes data binding in Angular even more powerful is the fact that the binding source can be an expression. Angular evaluates the expression between the double curly brace notation ({{ }}) before binding.

**Well implemented MVC (or MVVM or MVP or MVW)**

There has been a lot of debate over whether AngularJS implements MVC or MVVM or MVP. A pissed-off Igor Minar (Lead of AngularJS) decided to end the debate with this post in the AngularJS forum, deciding to call Angular a MVW framework: Model - View - Whatever!

**Declarative User Interface**

Being declarative, HTML feels more intuitive for defining the user interface. It is also easy to understand and manipulate. It provides a clear separation of the presentation layer from the imperative logic.

**Directives**

'Directives’ are Angular’s way of boosting HTML with additional functionality. It breaks the boundaries of traditional HTML elements and opens it up to infinite possibilities. The core concept behind this is 'custom elements’ driven by the 'Web Components’ initiative. But Angular likes to call it 'directives’.

**Dependency Injection**

AngularJS has a built-in Dependency Injection mechanism that works with almost all the JavaScript constructs of Angular. All Angular objects have their dependencies injected, be it framework dependencies or custom built dependencies.

**Testability**

AngularJS doesn’t treat testing as an afterthought. It is built with testability in mind. It ensures applications built with this framework are unit testing ready. This is mainly possible because AngularJS puts together the application using Dependency Injection.
